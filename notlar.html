                <h3>Big Idea 1: Collaboration and Program Development</h3>
                <p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Working together helps bring in different ideas and reduces mistakes. It's important to find good ways to work with others in coding so that you can solve problems better.</p>
                <p><strong>Computer Innovations:</strong> New inventions in computers can be both digital (software) or physical (hardware). We use many of them every day. To understand them, we should ask: Why were they made? What problems do they solve? What new things can they do?</p>
                <p><strong>Program Development:</strong> Developers think about what limits there are, what users need, and the goals. They plan and then build the program. Good documentation is important to track work and give credit to contributors.</p>
                <p><strong>Errors in Programming:</strong> Errors in coding include logic errors, syntax errors, runtime errors, and overflow errors. Testing and debugging are essential to fixing these mistakes.</p>

                <h3>Big Idea 2: Data Representation and Processing</h3>
                <p><strong>Binary and Bits:</strong> Bits represent data in a computer system. Eight bits make a byte. Binary is a system that uses only two digits: "1" means the electrical signal is present, and "0" means the signal is absent.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Compression:</strong> Lossless data compression keeps the original data intact, while lossy compression greatly reduces file sizes at the expense of detail.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Challenges:</strong> Data sets often need to be merged, cleaned, and may contain errors or incomplete information that must be addressed.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Programs process data to help people gain insights. Programmers use tools to clean and filter data for analysis.</p>

                <h3>Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming</h3>
                <p><strong>Assignments and Variables:</strong> A variable is a fundamental programming abstraction for storing and updating values. The assignment operator (‚Üê) assigns values to variables, enabling flexibility in managing program data.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Abstraction:</strong> Focuses on separating a data type's characteristics from its implementation. Examples include lists and strings for organizing and manipulating data.</p>
                <p><strong>Algorithms:</strong> A finite series of steps to solve a problem. It can be represented in pseudocode, diagrams, or natural language.</p>
                <p><strong>Strings:</strong> Strings are sequences of characters with operations like extracting substrings, searching for patterns, and concatenating or splitting text.</p>
                <p><strong>Boolean Expressions:</strong> Represent true/false values, essential for logical operations using operators like AND, OR, and NOT.</p>
                <p><strong>Conditionals and Iteration:</strong> Enables decision-making and repetition in programming through conditionals and loops.</p>
                <p><strong>Lists:</strong> Allow management of data by accessing, modifying, and determining the length of elements.</p>
                <p><strong>Binary Search:</strong> Halves sorted data iteratively to locate an element efficiently.</p>
                <p><strong>Procedures and Libraries:</strong> Reusable code blocks (procedures) and pre-written collections of code (libraries) simplify programming tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Random Values and Simulations:</strong> Random values add variability, and simulations model real-world scenarios for analysis.</p>
                <p><strong>Algorithmic Efficiency:</strong> Algorithms are evaluated for execution efficiency: reasonable (polynomial) or unreasonable (exponential).</p>

            <div class="note">
                <h3>Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Networks</h3>
                <p><strong>Computing Devices:</strong> Computers and computing systems use hardware and software together to process and store data. Computing devices include both common devices (computers, tablets, phones) and embedded systems in everyday objects.</p>
                <p><strong>Hardware Components:</strong> Computer hardware consists of input devices (keyboard, mouse), output devices (monitor, speakers), processing units (CPU), storage (RAM, hard drives), and paths for transmitting data (buses).</p>
                <p><strong>Software:</strong> Programs that run on computing devices, including system software (operating systems) and application software (programs that help users perform tasks).</p>
                <p><strong>Internet:</strong> A global network of autonomous systems that allows computers to communicate. It's built on standard protocols that allow digital devices to send and receive data.</p>
                <p><strong>Network Protocols:</strong> Rules that define how data is transmitted across networks, including TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS. These enable the internet's functionality and reliability.</p>
                <p><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> The protection of computing systems against unauthorized access or attacks. Security measures include encryption, authentication, and authorization.</p>
                <p><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> The ability of a system to continue operating despite failures in some components, achieved through redundancy and error correction mechanisms.</p>

                <h3>Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing</h3>
                <p><strong>Beneficial and Harmful Effects:</strong> Computing innovations can have both positive and negative impacts on society, economy, culture, and the environment. These effects must be carefully considered.</p>
                <p><strong>Digital Divide:</strong> Differences in access to computing devices and the internet, affecting economic, social, and educational opportunities for individuals and communities.</p>
                <p><strong>Computing Bias:</strong> Computing innovations can reflect and reinforce existing biases in society, affecting how they serve different populations.</p>
                <p><strong>Legal and Ethical Concerns:</strong> Computing raises issues related to privacy, intellectual property, security, and fair use. Laws and regulations govern many aspects of computing.</p>
                <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII):</strong> Information about individuals that can be used to track or identify them. Computing innovations often collect and use PII, raising privacy concerns.</p>
                <p><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Creative works protected by copyright, patent, and trademark laws. Digital media has complicated these protections through ease of copying and distribution.</p>
                <p><strong>Open Access:</strong> Movements advocating for free and open sharing of digital information, including open-source software, Creative Commons, and open data initiatives.</p>
                <p><strong>Crowdsourcing:</strong> Obtaining services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, especially online communities.</p>
