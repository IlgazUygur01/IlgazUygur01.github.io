                <h3>Big Idea 1: Collaboration and Program Development</h3>
                <p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Working together helps bring in different ideas and reduces mistakes. It's important to find good ways to work with others in coding so that you can solve problems better.</p>
                <p><strong>Computer Innovations:</strong> New inventions in computers can be both digital (software) or physical (hardware). We use many of them every day. To understand them, we should ask: Why were they made? What problems do they solve? What new things can they do?</p>
                <p><strong>Program Development:</strong> Developers think about what limits there are, what users need, and the goals. They plan and then build the program. Good documentation is important to track work and give credit to contributors.</p>
                <p><strong>Errors in Programming:</strong> Errors in coding include logic errors, syntax errors, runtime errors, and overflow errors. Testing and debugging are essential to fixing these mistakes.</p>

                <h3>Big Idea 2: Data Representation and Processing</h3>
                <p><strong>Binary and Bits:</strong> Bits represent data in a computer system. Eight bits make a byte. Binary is a system that uses only two digits: "1" means the electrical signal is present, and "0" means the signal is absent.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Compression:</strong> Lossless data compression keeps the original data intact, while lossy compression greatly reduces file sizes at the expense of detail.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Challenges:</strong> Data sets often need to be merged, cleaned, and may contain errors or incomplete information that must be addressed.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Programs process data to help people gain insights. Programmers use tools to clean and filter data for analysis.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <h3>Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming</h3>
                <p><strong>Assignments and Variables:</strong> A variable is a container for storing data, which can include numbers, Booleans, lists, or strings. The assignment operator <code>‚Üê</code> is used to give variables their values, enabling flexibility in program functionality.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Abstraction:</strong> This concept separates the essential features of a data type from the implementation details. Examples include lists and strings, which organize and manage data effectively.</p>
                <p><strong>Mathematical Expressions:</strong> Algorithms, structured as sequences, selections, and iterations, solve problems step-by-step. They are the foundation of efficient and accurate programming.</p>
                <p><strong>Boolean Expressions and Conditionals:</strong> Logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT form the basis of conditionals, enabling decision-making in programs using structures like `if`, `else if`, and `else`.</p>
                <p><strong>Iteration:</strong> Repeating parts of an algorithm until a specific condition is met is called iteration, often managed by loops like `REPEAT UNTIL` or `FOR` loops.</p>
